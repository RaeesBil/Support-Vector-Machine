Support Vector Machine is a powerful supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It works by finding the optimal hyperplane that separates data points of different classes with the largest margin. In cases where the data is not linearly separable, SVM uses kernel functions to project data into higher dimensions, making it separable. SVM is particularly effective in high-dimensional spaces and is widely used in fields like image classification and bioinformatics.

This dataset contains medical information related to breast cancer, including features such as radius_mean, texture_mean, perimeter_mean, and more, with the target variable being diagnosis (whether the tumor is benign or malignant). By applying SVM, we aim to classify whether a tumor is cancerous based on its measured properties. The analysis helps in early detection and accurate diagnosis of breast cancer, potentially improving patient outcomes by distinguishing between benign and malignant cases.
